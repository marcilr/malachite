Malachite workstation

================================
o Looks good!

o Consider removing the ms-teams packages:

malachite:~$ dpkg -l | grep teams
ii  t1-teams   4.17           all     Teams -- a PostScript font covering ASCII and basic Cyrillic
ii  teams      1.4.00.26453   amd64   Microsoft Teams for Linux is your chat-centered workspace in Of


o Updated debian with:
# aptitude update
# aptitude upgrade

Updated 107 packages.

o Migrated non-running malachite workstation, the Compulab fitlet2,
to the empty room across from Shena's office.  Added stray 16GB ram
I found with the Compulab parts.

o Migrated extra google wifi hotspot from tenant bathroom to
my new computer room and plugged the fitlet2.  The fitlet2 
boots and gets ethernet without issue.

Now need to work on latest task list.

o Only 16GB of ram on malachite:

malachite:~$ free -g
              total        used        free      shared  buff/cache   available
Mem:             15           0          13           0           1          14
Swap:             0           0           0

Think 100GB ssd drive:

malachite:~$ df -h

================================
Rebuild malachite workstation on new Compulab fitlet2.
Installed from debian-live-10.1.0-amd64-xfce.iso 
on 64GB Samsung SDCZ33 usb key ripped using rufus 
under windows 10.

No issues.
